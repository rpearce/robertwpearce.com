This isn‚Äôt the offical mantra, but it is how I think of the company:</p><blockquote><p><em>"Work when you want, where you want; just don‚Äôt be a jerk."</em></p></blockquote><p>Sound too good to be true? It is true.</p><p>Articulate is a ‚Äúremote‚Äù or ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù company, meaning it has no physical offices anywhere in the world, and everyone works wherever they like. Many of my colleagues work from home, whereas others tend to shift around a bit. It is this freedom that was (and <em>is</em>) a primary driving force for me wanting to work with this company.</p><h2 id="locations-thus-far">Locations Thus Far</h2><p>London is an expensive town, especially when you‚Äôre exchanging American Dollars for British Pounds Sterling. <a href="http://nomadlist.io">NomadList.IO</a>, a site that ranks cities to work remotely from, does not treat London kindly. At the time of writing, London has a -89 reputation‚Ä¶ on a scale where positive is a good thing. While it is an expensive town, it is also incredibly friendly, and there is no shortage of WiFi.</p><p>So, where have I worked over the past two days? For starters, I had a small taste of <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/South+Kensington/@51.49409,-0.17411,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x487605429cf5afd1:0xfef74f40edb435de?hl=en">South Kensington</a>. I worked in a small coffee shop 2 blocks from the <a href="http://www.vam.ac.uk">Victoria and Albert Museum</a>, and around lunch I took a stroll through a few of the free galleries before receiving word that my roommate‚Äôs girlfriend was locked <em>in</em> the apartment and could not get out. She was freed soon thereafter when I returned home and unlocked the door.</p><p>Today was spent mostly near Clapham Junction (5-10 minute walk from our house) in, first, a Starbucks and then in an Italian cafe up the hill from our house (1-2 minute walk). Starbucks is fantastic for attempting to offer free WiFi to their customers. I‚Äôm not sure who started that trend, but it is great. However, in any big city I go to, Starbucks‚Äô WiFi never actually works. It reminds me of the $1/ticket Megabus WiFi in the States (in short, it doesn‚Äôt work). Thankful as I am for even having access to the Internet, whereas so many people are without, I require it for my job. And I need it to be fast. Luckily, the little Italian cafe (ran by Francesca and, I believe, her son) have blazing fast internet.</p><h2 id="the-experience">The Experience</h2><p>I love <em>not</em> working in an office. I love the freedom. I love being able to walk and ride around and do what I want (or need) to do while still being a contributing member of my team.</p><p>Many people I know ask me,</p><blockquote><p><em>"When are you going to get a real job?"</em></p></blockquote><p>I always respond with, ‚ÄúOh, I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶‚Äù But what I want to say is,</p><blockquote><p>"I have a real job. I have a salary, I have benefits and I have responsibility. <strong>Just because your definition of a real job involves long hours, living for weekends and generally hating life does not mean that it is a universal truth by which all must abide.</strong>"</p></blockquote><p>Instead of spending loads of time during the workday perusing <a href="http://www.cnn.com" title="CNN">CNN</a> or <a href="http://www.reddit.com" title="Reddit">Reddit</a> or <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com" title="Hacker News">Hacker News</a>, I am out exploring meeting new people and taking in as much as my limited time here will allow me.</p><p>London, so far, has been amazing and has allowed me to leave my comfort zone and discover people, places and experiences that I would never have had if I would have just stayed home.</p></section></main><footer><span aria-hidden="true" class="heart">‚ô•</span><span aria-hidden="true">&rarr;</span><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/rpearce/">Sponsor my work</a><span aria-hidden="true">&larr;</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="heart">‚ô•</span></footer><script async> (() => { const themeEl = document.querySelector('[data-select-theme]'); if (themeEl) { themeEl.querySelector('[value="'+window.site.prefTheme+'"]').selected = 'selected'; themeEl.addEventListener('change', e => { window.site.setTheme(e.target.value); }); } const fontEl = document.querySelector('[data-select-font]'); if (fontEl) { fontEl.querySelector('[value="'+window.site.prefFont+'"]').selected = 'selected'; fontEl.addEventListener('change', e => { window.site.setFont(e.target.value); }) } })(); </script></body></html>
