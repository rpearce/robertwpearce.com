Apart from being less likely to cook their own meals, the general lack of exercise people also experience while on the move in new, unfamiliar places, creates a cycle of unhealthiness that is difficult to break. Since I&#39;ve moved to London, I have had to consider my options and find a way to maintain a healthy diet while also getting regular, meaningful exercise. Luckily, London itself has come to the rescue.</p><p>Since 2007, <a href="http://www.tgogc.com/Gyms" title="The Great Outdoor Gym Company">The Great Outdoor Gym Company</a>, at the behest of local councils, has installed hundreds of outdoor gyms &amp; obstacles in parks all throughout the UK (notably London). There are surely other vendors, but this is the only one of which I know.</p><p>The gyms sport everything from pullup &amp; parallel bars to vertical presses to elliptical machines. Clapham Common, where I exercise, possesses at least three outdoor gyms that are heavily used every day and have surprisingly low maintenance plus resistance to the elements.</p><blockquote><p><em>&quot;Great; loads of gyms! Now what?&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>The phrase <em>weary traveler</em> is fairly descriptive of the effects of travel on people. Whether you are walking, sitting or sleeping for a long time, the effects are similar: you are tired! And the last thing you want to do when you&#39;re tired is exercise. This needs to change.</p><p>Do you have a good work ethic? Are you rarely late to work or meetings? What is it about these that make you attend and do so in a timely fashion? You probably say, &quot;This is something I have to do, so I am going to power through and do it, even if I don&#39;t want to.&quot; So why not treat exercise in this manner?</p><p>In short, you need to learn to <em>treat exercise like an unavoidable daily event</em>; like a meeting. If you can do this, then all procrastination and &quot;I&#39;ll do it when I feel like it&quot; excuses go right out the door.</p><p>If you are worried about not having a place to work out in the area you are traveling to, do a little research beforehand.</p><ul><li>Google for outdoor/indoor gyms in the area</li><li>Youtube exercises you can do in your hotel room</li><li>Use Yelp to find places where you can eat right &mdash; not lazily</li></ul><p>Ultimately, all of these decisions come down to you. Whether you are on a short trip or are doing extensive traveling, if you take it upon yourself to strive for a sound mind and body, you will find a way to better yourself while on the road.</p></div></article><section class="section--padded bg--gray"><div class="layout--constrained"><h2>Get Updates</h2><!-- Begin MailChimp Signup Form --><form action="//robertwpearce.us13.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=2df44e8960266388bff165fa6&amp;id=ee2f2a3737" method="post" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" target="_blank" novalidate class="form"><div id="mce-responses"><div class="response" id="mce-error-response" style="display:none"></div><div class="response" id="mce-success-response" style="display:none"></div></div><div style="position: absolute; left: -5000px" aria-hidden="true"><input type="text" name="b_2df44e8960266388bff165fa6_ee2f2a3737" tabindex="-1" value=""></div><div class="form__container"><label for="mce-EMAIL" class="form__label">Email Address</label><input type="email" value="" id="mce-EMAIL" class="form__input" name="EMAIL" placeholder="you@greatemail.com"> <input type="submit" value="Subscribe" name="subscribe" class="form__submit"></div><small>Note: I will <em>never</em> give out your email nor spam you.
