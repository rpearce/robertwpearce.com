Ever since [Nate DaPore](https://twitter.com/natedapore) allegedly coined the
phrase ["Silicon Harbor"](http://charlestonmag.com/features/the_rise_of_silicon_harbor)
for Charleston, South Carolina (even though other cities around the world already
used this term, such as [Hamburg, Germany](https://twitter.com/siliconharbor)),
folks wanting to look like they know what they're talking about have continued
to use the phrase "Silicon Harbor" _[ad](http://www.fastcompany.com/1839445/introducing-silicon-harbor-charleston-sc-home-twitpic-and-amazons-createspace)
[nauseam](http://www.charlestoncitypaper.com/charleston/silicon-harbor-is-becoming-a-major-player-in-the-nations-tech-scene/Content?oid=4604950)_.
If Charleston tech companies would like to move forward and be taken seriously
by other cities and players in this game, they need to stop emulating and start
innovating. This begins with a proper name.

"Silicon Valley," the name that was copied and applied to Charleston as "Silicon
Harbor," got its nickname from the concentration of companies who specialized in
making semiconductors and other computer-related products in the southern part
of the San Francisco Bay Area. Silicon, which itself is a metalloid that is the
most common element on our planet besides oxygen, is not unique to the Bay Area.
It is in that location that an entire economy and culture grew around the
semiconductor and then microprocessor and then software industries. Charleston,
however, has no such story to support calling itself "Silicon X." Here is a list
of locations that have also called themselves "Silicon X" in the hopes of
getting the scraps from Silicon Valley:

* "Silicon Beach" - Bournemouth, England
* "Silicon Docks" - Dublin, Ireland
* "Silicon Harbor" - Hamburg, Germany
* "Silicon Lagoon" - Lagos, Nigeria
* "Silicon Peninsula" - Dailiar, China
* "Silicon Savannah" - Nairobi, Kenya

...and many more from the [List of Places with "Silicon"
Names](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_places_with_%22Silicon%22_names).

While this might all sound quite negative, it is necessary in order to break
folks out of their "Silicon Harbor" daydreaming and recognize that riding the
coattails of successful communities is not always the path to creating one.
A community should be able to stand on its own merits, be unique in the world
and at least strive to be its own unicorn-like entity.

Charleston has an [impressive number of technology and creative
companies](http://boomtownroi.com/chstechmap), as
[BoomTown's](http://boomtownroi.com) useful map compilation shows, given the
size of the city. Ask most anyone in the developed world what San Francisco
means to them and the answer will include "Silicon Valley," "technology
companies" and "innovation." Ask the same about Charleston and the answer will
include "beautiful architecture," "great food," "Southern Hospitality" and
_maybe_ "Boeing." Nowhere outside of South Carolina will you hear people speak
of Charleston's technology scene.

Why is this? Is it a lack of employment opportunities offered by companies in
the area? Somewhat. Is it a lack of marketing? Partially. Is it a lack of
novelty and significance in global consumers' lives? Definitely.

If Charleston is not going to be cranking out Apple/Google/???-ambitious tech,
then it needs to learn to compete on other fronts. Human resource software,
real estate software, healthcare software and assistive financial software are
all important industries and employ a great number of people in the Charleston
area. They also benefit their community and all give back in innumerable ways.
However, there have yet to be any ground-breaking technologies to come out of
Charleston since [Automated Trading Desk](http://www.atdesk.com), formerly led
by [Steve Swanson](http://sb.cofc.edu/officeofthedean/boardofgovernors/swanson.php),
busted on to the scene in the late 80s through the late 2000s with its
utilization of high-frequency trading, a technology that revolutionized the
stock trading industry. If Charleston dares to be great, then it should lead by
example.

Personally, I am not as successful as the current folks [Mayor Joe
Riley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_P._Riley,_Jr.) courts and supports
as drivers of community growth. I have nothing to show. But what I do have is an
outside view of the community while still maintaining my membership of it and
participation in it. What I see is a city that has many of the traits of a
progressive city on the rise but which constantly compares itself to others
instead of charging forward as a leader.

It is in this light that I suggest Charleston abandon the overused and clich√©
"Silicon X" tag and adopt a new nickname (sorry to all you organizations who
have named yourself "Silicon Harbor X"). Nobody uses it outside of the
Charleston tech community, and nobody will (just as you don't call Baltimore, MD
the "Digital Harbor"). It's time to move on.

This new nickname should represent the vast presence of technology companies as
well as evoke all the right emotions for emphasizing that Charleston is a
fantastic place to work, live and raise a family. But it should, above all else,
represent the location and culture, itself, without having to rely on an
overused, 60-year old term from the other side of the country.
