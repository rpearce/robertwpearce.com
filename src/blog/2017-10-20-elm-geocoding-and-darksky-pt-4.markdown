This is part 4 of a multipart series where we will be building a small weather forecast app using [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/), [Google's Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start) and the [DarkSky API](https://darksky.net/dev/). Instead of doing everything in one massive post, I've broken the steps down into parts of a series. Here is the series plan:

* [Pt. 1 – Setup Elm & Proxy Servers](/blog/elm-geocoding-and-darksky-pt-1-setup-elm-and-proxy-servers.html)
* [Pt. 2 – Geocoding an Address](/blog/elm-geocoding-and-darksky-pt-2-geocoding-an-address.html)
* [Pt. 3 – Fetching the Current Weather](/blog/elm-geocoding-and-darksky-pt-3-fetching-the-current-weather.html)
* Pt. 4 – Extracting our Elm Code
* <span class="faded">(wip) Pt. 5 – Styling in Elm</span>

If you'd like to code along with this tutorial, check out [part 1](/blog/elm-geocoding-and-darksky-pt-1-setup-elm-and-proxy-servers.html), [part 2](/blog/elm-geocoding-and-darksky-pt-2-fetching-the-current-weather.html) and [part 3](/blog/elm-geocoding-and-darksky-pt-3-fetching-the-current-weather.html) first to get set up.

_Note: to learn more about the Elm language and syntax, check out the [Elm Tutorial](https://www.elm-tutorial.org/en/), the [EggHead.io Elm course](https://egghead.io/courses/start-using-elm-to-build-web-applications), subscribe to [DailyDrip's Elm Topic](https://www.dailydrip.com/topics/elm), [James Moore's Elm Courses](http://courses.knowthen.com) or check out [Elm on exercism.io](http://exercism.io/languages/elm/about)._

## Overview

## Project Source Code
The project we're making will be broken into parts here (branches will be named for each part): [https://github.com/rpearce/elm-geocoding-darksky/](https://github.com/rpearce/elm-geocoding-darksky/). Be sure to check out the other branches to see the other parts as they become available.

The code for this part is located in the `pt-4` branch: [https://github.com/rpearce/elm-geocoding-darksky/tree/pt-4](https://github.com/rpearce/elm-geocoding-darksky/tree/pt-4).
