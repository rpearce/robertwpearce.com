2 months ago I decided I wanted to go to London for an indefinite amount of time.

There were no external driving factors behind this decision; no significant other, no new job, no criminal charges, no desire to leave my home in Charleston, SC.

I love my family, friends, beaches, the spartina grass (marshes), the plough mud, and the
odd&mdash;yet wonderful&mdash;assortment of personalities that exist in Charleston.

* * *

> _&quot;If everything is so wonderful, why leave?&quot;_

* * *

Because I can. Because of this list of things I don't have:

*   no wife
*   no kids
*   no house
*   no debt

Here is another way to view this list:

*   wife-free
*   kid-free
*   house-free
*   debt-free

I understand that &frac34; of the items on that list are desired by many folks, and that what I have just described could also be classified as &quot;responsibility-free.&quot; Or, as I have understood before, that _the life of the traveler is rootless and thereby does not bear the burden of creating something lasting_. I find this statement accurate; however, I also find that safety makes me complacent and breeds stagnation and settling: the opposite of my battle and striving for excellence, or the Greek _aretÃ©_. Thus, in order to better myself, I decided to shake things up a bit!

Additionally, and worthy of note, every single person I spoke with about traveling this way said this:

* * *

> _&quot;If I were you, I'd be gone in a second.&quot;_

* * *

I will miss my grandparents, parents, siblings, my dogs, aunts, uncles, cousins, surfing, and everything that makes Charleston great.

But I shall return!

## My Time Thus far

After serenading the Delta counter attendants in the Charleston airport with my guitar and song, I had a sleepless and safe flight to London!

When I finished riding a number of trains and other ground transportation, I arrived in [Clapham](https://www.google.com/maps/preview?q=clapham+london&ie=UTF-8&ei=ApsEVOSbJaeu0QXc84HYCw&ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ "Clapham Google Map") at Sam's house, where I was greeted with smiles, cheers, and Heineken.

Soon thereafter, I decided to get to know my new area better. My solution? _Go on a run and get lost._ Here is my fitbit from that day:

You could say I got lost. I like to think I was &quot;exploring.&quot; Nevertheless, I had a fantastic time and look forward to many more.
