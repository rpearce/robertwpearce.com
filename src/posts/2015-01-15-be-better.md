We are not always the people we strive to be. Many of us want to be better versions of ourselves: wiser, kinder, stronger, skinnier. However, we often find it is ourselves that get in the way of this.

Some time ago, I began removing things from my life that did not help me on the path to being the person I desired to be. This is a very painful yet effective attempt at a remedy. Unfortunately, it is only a piece of the puzzle. While external factors influence our habits and tendencies a great deal, all decisions have an ultimate decision-maker: you.

I could go on with this post for days. Instead, I'll make it simple:

* Be kinder to the cashier at the grocery store.

* Be someone whose positive attitude inspires others.

* Be confident in accomplishing your goals or lifestyle changes.

* __Be better than you were yesterday.__
