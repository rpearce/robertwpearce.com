This is an accounting of how I recently went all-in on
[Neovim](https://neovim.io) with its Lua-based configuration ecosystem.

Here is my [nvim config at time of
writing](https://github.com/rpearce/dotfiles/tree/a2c9e46bb413039cbf98d7ea1ab90bf6ca023178/tools/conf/nvim).
This folder just needs to live in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (typically, `~/.config`),
and in my case, [I symlink it from my dotfiles to there](https://github.com/rpearce/dotfiles/blob/a2c9e46bb413039cbf98d7ea1ab90bf6ca023178/tools/conf/install#L55).

In this short post, I'll share about the switch, some screenshots, and list the
tools I'm using at the time of writing.

## Backstory

I've used Neovim for years now, but I've always had one
foot in the [VIM](https://www.vim.org) world: a somewhat lengthy `.vimrc`
(standard fare), plus [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) for
managing plugins. I also used [ale](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale) and
[coc-nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) for managing linters and LSPs.

This worked great for years, but I ran into an issue at work where `ale` and
`coc-nvim` seemed to no longer play well together. After trying to fix it in my
spare time and failing, I decided to completely burn things down and start fresh
with _The Neovim Way_.

## How the switch went

Most of the experience was dancing between reading official docs, reading blog
posts, watching YouTube videos, reading source code, searching through GitHub
issues, noting `CHANGELOG` differences since these kindly-written resources
were created, etc. It was a complete hodgepodge approach, but it's typically how
I learn things, and it worked out over ~5 nights.

If you want a breakdown of how to structure your files and write plugin configs,
send me an email, and I'll consider writing some more about this!

## The verdict

This tooling is incredible: the configs are almost completely declarative,
updating tools is easy as pie, and it is all unbelievably fast.

At work, the ability to lint and typecheck a massive JS/TS project immediately,
while I'm typing (and without any weird UI freezes...looking at you, VSCode), is
critical. I am especially surprised by how good
[Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) is; it's file
finding and live grep are _fast_ and quite pleasant to use.
