## Ōhope
* Ōhope Beach: https://goo.gl/maps/Pp5VLnJHHHhh83DSA
* Kohi Point Scenic Track: https://goo.gl/maps/gjAkfTfoVLmtojxh7
  * Excellent walk at the end (or start?) of Ōhope Beach that goes up and over a
  cliff and down to a secluded beach that is only a good idea to go to when it's
  not high tide. Takes you to [Otarawairere
  Bay](https://goo.gl/maps/btgdHkC3VkS4NV379).
* Ōhope Lookout: https://goo.gl/maps/J3jkf15cofNEQqnY9
* Ōhope Habourside Trail: https://goo.gl/maps/ZytmV5jzq4cV8ZWD7
* Port Ōhope General Store: https://goo.gl/maps/nsujvdqtp9xvbVq38
* Fisherman's Wharf Cafe: https://goo.gl/maps/FZA21FsmvyEPgM3Y7
* Port Ohope Dock/Pier: https://goo.gl/maps/WRbttdt4CQDPaZYm7
  * Excellent place to fish or jump off the pier and swim for a bit! Lots of
  fun.
* Maraetotara Reserve: https://goo.gl/maps/ZesGbibHgaVkXhhK8
* Cadera: https://goo.gl/maps/EAgELyvDEbqNChSu8

## Opotiki
* Pakowhai Ki Otutaopuku Bridge / Dunes Trail: https://goo.gl/maps/EoDKYbCREx29sD5i7
  * This is a suspension footbridge and walking trail. I met a man and a child
  who were jumping off the bridge, swimming to shore, and jumping again, and I
  decided to join them. The water was very deep, but you should always be
  cautious when doing something potentially dangerous.
* Waiōtahi Beach: https://goo.gl/maps/p6gy4ur2qctmKLvc6

## Whakatāne
* Whakatāne Heads: https://goo.gl/maps/WXDAdy7MyWFmFPVp7
* Muriwai's Cave: https://goo.gl/maps/XiMEpSyN6QE7vEez5

## Whakaari (White Island)
We had the privilege to take a 2+ hour boat ride to this volcano and explore it
a bit, but as it recently erupted and tragically claimed and ruined lives, you
will probably be unable to go there. If you for some reason make your way to the
island, be aware that you might die and might put others in harm's way.
