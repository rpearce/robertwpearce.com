## Activities / Things To See
* Excellent hike leaving from the ferry terminal at Matiatia Bay
  * From the perspective of exiting the ferry, when you get to the start of the
  terminal, there is a rocky beach on your right. If you walk on/just above that
  until the end of it, there is a sign (and perhaps information placard)
  detailing a hillside walk that begins there. Follow this trail up and along
  the hill to the right for as long as you like and enjoy the excellent views.
  * The [Headland Sculpture Walk](https://goo.gl/maps/Rychd3gcacvaoqraA) is a
  part of this, so keep that map reference.
* Wine trail leading to/from Onetangi Bay (must do):
  * We were introduced to this because we stayed next to Casita Miro.
  * Starting at the Wild on Waiheke / Tantals Estate wineries, there is the
  ability to walk north from those on to Stonyridge Vineyard and Te Motu
  Vineyard. That by itself is great! But you can go further. You can continue
  walking between vineyards on a clear-cut trail (there are probably little
  signs... emphasis on probably) and follow that up and over a hill and through
  a little tree cover up to Casita Miro (which is also right next to Obsidian
  Vineyard). You can turn back here or continue east down Sea View Rd. and
  follow any path you see that takes you down to the beach (Onetangi Bay), where
  you'll find Charlie Farley's: an excellent spot for sunset. Then again, any of
  these spots are great for sunset. You can also flip this recommendation around
  and go from Onetangi Bay and end up at Wild on Waiheke.
* Onetangi Bay: https://goo.gl/maps/FfHjRa9KVocvGfP86
  * Really nice beach with some restaurants. End (or beginning) of a days' wine
  trail walk. See Charlie Farley's and Casita Miro for food & drink options.
* Stony Batter Historic Reserve: https://goo.gl/maps/AYMPq15ov8mbKS7L7
  * This historic reserve is a nice little drive to the northeast corner of the
  island that takes you down gravel roads to a beautiful corner of the island
  where you can walk/hike, see old WWII relics and see vineyards all around.
  Great spot to explore; highly recommend this. Keep your eye out for [wekas](
