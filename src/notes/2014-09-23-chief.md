Tonight, I lost a dear friend.

On this day, 23 September 2014, my family lost a constant. Chief, a member of
our family, passed &mdash; by our hand &mdash; on account of aggressive cancer.

Chief made me better. Or, Chief made me make myself better.
I will never forget one moment, one line of his life, I swear.
He will always be my brother, my son, my guide.

I love you, man.
