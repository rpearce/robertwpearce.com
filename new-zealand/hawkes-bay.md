Things to do and see in and around Hawkes Bay in New New Zealand.

Or go back to the [main New Zealand index](/new-zealand/index.html).

## Napier
While we've been to Napier a couple of times, we never stayed and just wandered
the streets and enjoyed having a picnic at the Beach Domain.

## Te Mata Peak
Hands down one of my favourite walking areas. Drive to the parking area where
there are some toilets, picnic tables and maps, then look at the maps to
determine which route you want to take. I highly recommend ones that go through
the redwood tree forest and also go up to the top of Te Mata Peak. We came back
here again and again to walk. You should also read about the MƒÅori legendary
history of this area.

## Sunrise at Ocean Beach and More
Sunrise at Ocean Beach is spectacular, and it must be experienced. If you want
to check out Waimarama, then on your way back, take Waimarama Road to Waimarama
and for a little walk in that sleepy beach town. If not, the next road on your
left will be Maraetotara Road, and this will take you to Maraetotara Falls in
just a few minutes. After the falls and you head back towards Havelock North,
make sure to stop at Red Bridge Coffee, a small shipping container coffee shop
in a field, and hang with the locals.
