  * This one is very near Sandfly Bay but is quite interesting to get to.

    First you need to find a place to leave you car; we left ours on the side of the
    road when our car couldn't make it any further down the road. Once you get on
    the road that Google Maps has told you is the right one, park anywhere on there
    (or simply go as far as you can and walk the rest).

    Next, you'll walk down the road, passing by paddocks with horses on your left
    and sheep on your right, and you'll come to what seems to be a dead end leading
    you down a ditch – this is the correct way. Given how much it has rained, it'll
    be a wet walk. Keep following the sketchy-looking ditch for a ways, and right
    when you think you want to turn back, keep going around the corner, and you'll
    see a sign and a way to hop the fence (a
    [stile](https://www.google.com/search?q=stile&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjsia7blYzgAhXBXSsKHa9LDxQQ_AUIDigB&biw=1440&bih=803))
    and begin the _real_ trek down to the beach.

    This next bit requires a little faith. Once you begin your way through the bush,
    make sure you periodically remember where the orange ribbons are or are least
    some landmarks (e.g. "we came from _this_ side of the only grove of trees in the
    area"). You'll basically follow a not-maintained-at-all track towards the ocean
    that you can hear in the distance. You'll be able to tell the track from where
    it's been beaten down; maybe do some beating of your own.

    Eventually you'll get to the beach, see some fur seals, have a nice time, and
    find your way back.
