## Walks / Hikes

### Lake Hayes Circuit

### Ben Lomond Track
Full day hike that is a bit treacherous past "The Saddle," but the views are
worth it, and there are typically [kea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kea)
hanging out up there. 100% recommend taking the Gondola to Bob's Peak and then
continuing on from there.

### Welch Kern / Queenstown Gardens
A quick walk from downtown Queenstown puts you on a peninsula with gardens and a
bit of forest. There is a path that leads around the edge of the peninsula, and
it also has a disc golf course nearby.

### Frankton Arm Walk
Very calm, chill walk along the Frankton Arm and away from the traffic. I
recommend parking at [The Boatshed Cafe](#the-boatshed-cafe) and picking up the
trail there to walk for a bit towards Queenstown. There are multiple other entry
points, as well.

## Food / Drink

### Fergburger
Pretty good burgers in downtown Queenstown but always packed. From what I've
seen, early morning or around 2:45pm are good times to go.

## Activities / Things To See

### Bob's Peak
Where to begin? Apart from being the starting point for the Ben Lomond track, it
also sports a bunjy jump, luging, a cafe, bar, gift store and great views. You
can take a gondola ride to the top (or walk, if you prefer), and even take
mountain bikes with you if you want to ride them down.

### TSS Earnslaw Steamship Lake Cruise

### Shotover Jet
This is a fun (yet cold!) experience on a jet boat that can run in 3cm of water
(no outboard motor).

### Paradise
Search around to see if you can find how to get there. It's a decent drive along
an unsealed road that is gorgeous, and you have to ford the River Jordan to get
there (4-wheel drive recommended, though you can walk through it with ease).
It's a beautiful area, but don't expect to see much in the way of humans. You'll
know you're there when you see the sign that says "Paradise."
