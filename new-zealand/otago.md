#### That Wanaka Tree Walk
Classic walk from lakefront Wanaka that takes you past
[#thatwanakatree](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/thatwanakatree/). Be
sure to be mindful of others while there and cleanup after yourself.

#### Diamond Lake Circuit and Rocky Mountain Summit
This can be a big hike, a medium hike or a small walk. It's a 10 minute walk or
so to the lake itself, which is wonderful to walk around. There is also a
lookout you can hike up to if you're interested in seeing it from above. If you
continue on past the lookout and decide to do the Rocky Mountain Summit, as
well, make sure you take the _Western Route_ (go left when you have a choice...
you'll know when) so that you can see the good views as you come down.
Gorgeous views over Lake Wanaka are at the top, but make sure you're careful, as
this can get muddy and can be steep at times.

#### Mt Iron Loop Track
Gorgeous views await those who walk up to the top. This is nota  difficult walk
if you keep to the Wanaka Lake-facing side. Note: This "loop" goes _over_ the
mountain instead of around it, and the Albert Town side is much tougher.

#### Blue Pools Track
Those gorgeous blue pools you always see pictures of. Be sure to continue
walking past them into the valley. Watch out for the sand fleas down by the
water, though! They pack a _wicked_ punch that you won't notice for a day or two
that is just like North American fleas.

#### The Neck
You _get to_ pass over The Neck to get to the [Blue Pools
Track](#blue-pools-track), and what a treat this is: lookouts over lakes as you
drive.

#### Bannockburn Sluicings
Known as "the heart of the desert," Bannockburn is New Zealand's own man-made
desert (not on purpose) that was a result of a type of gold-mining back in the
day known as sluicing. The are tracks all around this area that also highlight
an old dam, holes bored into cliffsides that diggers used, an old house and nice
scenery to boot.
