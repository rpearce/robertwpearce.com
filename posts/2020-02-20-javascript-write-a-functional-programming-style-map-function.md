_Many thanks to [Helen Durrant](https://twitter.com/goodforenergy) for reviewing
this post and offering stellar suggestions._

In this post, we will write a functional programming-style implementation of
JavaScript's [`map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map)
function that not only works with [`Array`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)
but any data structure that implements a `map` method. Such data structures are
known as [`Functors`](https://github.com/hemanth/functional-programming-jargon#functor).
Some examples of `Functors` are the algebraic data types[^1]
[`Maybe`](https://crocks.dev/docs/crocks/Maybe.html) and
[`Async`](https://crocks.dev/docs/crocks/Async.html) (prior knowledge of them is
not required, and out of the two, we'll only use `Maybe`).

* know how to implement a generic `map` function that includes functions for
  `map`ping `Array`s, `Object`s, and `Functor`s
* understand how to use `map` in a variety of scenarios
* know how to write a simple `compose` function and use composition
* know how to reliably test values for their types
* have received a small introduction to algebraic data types via the
  [`crocks`](https://crocks.dev) library

## The Goal: `map` All the Things

Today we are going to write a `map` function that does the following:

* accepts a transformation function that takes in some argument of type `a` and
  transforms it into a value of type `b`; i.e., `(a -> b)`
* accepts and handles any of the following data types:
  * [`Array`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)
  * [`Object`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)
  * [`Function`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function)
  * [`Functors`](https://github.com/hemanth/functional-programming-jargon#functor)
    (e.g., [`Maybe`](https://crocks.dev/docs/crocks/Maybe.html))

Sounds easy, right? We'll see!

## Defining Our `map` Function

There are some things we already know about our `map` function:

* it's called `map` (yay! nailed it!)
* it takes a function (`fn`) and then some datum (`m`[^2])[^3]
* it returns the datum as transformed by said function

[^2]: `m` for [`Monoid`](https://github.com/hemanth/functional-programming-jargon#monoid) &ensp;

[^3]: Wondering why the data comes last? Check out [Brian Lonsdorf's "Hey
Underscore, You're Doing It Wrong!" talk](https://youtu.be/m3svKOdZijA). The
tl;dr is that you should arrange your arguments from least likely to change to
most likely to change in order to pave the way for partial application and
greater code reuse. &ensp;

Let's sketch it out:

```javascript
const map = (fn, m) => {
  // ???
}
```

Okay, it's a start. This could conceivably be used like this:

```javascript
map(x => x.id, [{ id: 1 }, { id: 2 }])     // [1, 2]
map(x => x.id, [{ id: 'a' }, { id: 'b' }]) // ['a', 'b']
```

Note the repetition of the `x => x.id`. Let's try pulling it out into a
variable:

```javascript
const propId = x => x.id
map(propId, [{ id: 1 }, { id: 2 }])     // [1, 2]
map(propId, [{ id: 'a' }, { id: 'b' }]) // ['a', 'b']
```

Alas, that's not much better â€“ now we're just repeating the variable!

Instead, what if we could store our combination of function and `map` in a
variable and then use that to call with our different data? By [_partially
applying_](https://github.com/hemanth/functional-programming-jargon#partial-application)
the function to `map`, we can!

```javascript
const mapId = map.bind(null, x => x.id)
mapId([{ id: 1 }, { id: 2 }])     // [1, 2]
mapId([{ id: 'a' }, { id: 'b' }]) // ['a', 'b']
```

Nice! Now, let's go back to our sketch. Let's turn our _binary_ function (which
takes _two_ parameters) to instead be a series of _unary_ functions
(which take _one_ parameter[^4]).

[^4]: https://github.com/hemanth/functional-programming-jargon#arity &ensp;

```javascript
const map = fn => m => {
  // ???
}
```

Wow, that was easy. By default, languages like
[Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/higher-order-functions) and
[Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org) automatically
[curry](https://robertwpearce.com/ramda-chops-function-currying.html) all of
their function parameters. There are [ways to automate that in
JavaScript](https://robertwpearce.com/ramda-chops-function-currying.html), but
for today, we will _manually_ curry functions by using arrow functions to
simulate it: `const sum = a => b => a + b`, for example.

Lastly, on the function definition side, it would be helpful for readers of our
code to understand more about the intended types. In lieu of JavaScript
not having a static type checker and me not knowing
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) yet, we'll do this using a
Haskell-style pseudo-type signature:

```haskell
map :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```

And we can place that as a comment above our function:

```javascript
// map :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
const map = fn => m => {
  // ???
}
```

Woah, woah, woah! What's all this? Let's break it down.

```haskell
map :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
--  |     |            |     |   |      |
--  1     2            3     4   5      6
```

1. Can be read, "has the type of"
1. Anything after `::` and before `=>` in a signature is a [class
   constraint](http://www.learnyouahaskell.com/types-and-typeclasses). This
   says we're going to use something in the type signature that obeys the
   Functor Laws[^5], _identity_ and [_composition_](https://robertwpearce.com/ramda-chops-function-composition.html).
   The lowercase `f` represents what the `Functor` will be in the signature.
1. Our `map`ping function; e.g., `x => x.id`, like we did above.
1. `->` Arrows are used in type signatures to say "then return...". In our
   `map` signature, we say, "We accept a function from `a` to `b` then return a
   function that accepts `f` of `a` and then return `f` of `b`". If we were
   summing three numbers, `sum3 :: Number -> Number -> Number -> Number`, this
   would read, "`sum3` has the type of an expression that accepts a `Number`
   that returns a function that accepts a `Number` then returns a function that
   accepts a `Number` and then returns a `Number`."
1. `f a` says that a `Functor`, `f`, wraps some other type, `a`. A concrete
   example of this is `[Number]`, which is a list (or `Array`) of `Number`s.
1. `f b` says that a `Functor`, `f`, wraps some other type, `b`. Why isn't it
   `a`? This signifies that when we take in the `Functor` of any type `a`, it's
   totally cool if you want to change the return type inside the `Functor`. For
   example, when we take `[{ id: 'a' }, { id: 'b' }]` and use `map` to turn that
   into `['a', 'b']`, we're taking `[Object]` (a list of `Object`s) and turning
   that into `[String]` (a list of `String`s).

[^5]: https://github.com/hemanth/functional-programming-jargon#functor &ensp;

All together now! "`map` has the type of an expression where `f` is a `Functor`,
and it accepts a function from `a` to `b`, then returns a function that accepts
`f` of `a`, and then returns `f` of `b`."

## `map` an `Array`

Let's `map` an `Array`!

Remember our `Functor` class constraint?

```haskell
map :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```

Guess what? `Array` is a `Functor`s! How? It adheres to the laws of _identity_
and _composition_:

```javascript
// identity
[1,2,3].map(x => x) // [1,2,3]

// composition
const add10 = x => x + 10
const mult2 = x => x * 2
[1,2,3].map(add10).map(mult2)     // [ 22, 24, 26 ]
// is equivalent to...
[1,2,3].map(x => mult2(add10(x))) // [ 22, 24, 26 ]

// another example of the composition law
const compose = (f, g) => x => f(g(x))
mult2(add10(2)) === compose(mult2, add10)(2) // true

// and applied back to our prior example
[1,2,3].map(add10).map(mult2)      // [ 22, 24, 26 ]
[1,2,3].map(x => mult2(add10(x)))  // [ 22, 24, 26 ]
[1,2,3].map(compose(mult2, add10)) // [ 22, 24, 26 ]
```

Through `map`, `Array` is a `Functor`. A way to quickly determine if something
is a `Functor` is to ask, "Does it implement `map` / is it `map`pable?"

Since we know that `Array` is `map`pable, we can use our `map` function to check
if the `f a` parameter is an `Array` and then use the build in
`Array.prototype.map` function to get from `a` to `b`:

```javascript
// map :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
const map = fn => m => {
  if (isArray(m)) {
    return mapArray(fn, m)
  }
}

// isArray :: a -> Bool
const isArray = x => Array.isArray(x)

// mapArray :: ((a -> b), Array a) -> Array b
const mapArray = (fn, m) => m.map(x => fn(x))
```

Here, we use `Array.isArray()`[^6] to see if the argument, `m`, is an `Array`,
then we call a function, `mapArray`, that handles the `map`ping of the `Array`.

[^6]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/isArray &ensp;

_You might be thinking: why `m.map(x => fn(x))` and not `m.map(fn)`? As you might
remember from [my article on re-implementing
`Array.prototype.map`](https://robertwpearce.com/javascript-understand-array-prototype-map-by-reimplementing-it.html),
there are a few other arguments that the native implementation of `map` provide,
as well as some potential changes to the `this` keyword in your callback
function scope. Instead of allowing those to pass through, we simply take the
first argument, the currently iterated value, and send that to the callback
function[^7]._

[^7]: Check out [ramda.js' `addIndex` function](https://ramdajs.com/docs/#addIndex)
to see a different pattern for working with indices and `Array`s. &ensp;

Now that we've seen the easy way to do `map` with `Array`, let's see what this
would look like if we felt like implementing `mapArray` ourselves:

```javascript
// mapArray :: ((a -> b), Array a) -> Array b
const mapArray = (fn, m) => {
  const newArray = []

  for (let i = 0; i < m.length; i++) {
    newArray[i] = fn(m[i])
  }

  return newArray
}
```

Not too shabby! All we do is create a new `Array` and set the results of
calling the callback function with each item to its index in the new `Array`
and then return that `Array`.

Do you think our `map` function can handle an `Array` of `Array`s?

```javascript
map(x => x * 2)([ [1,2], [3,4], [5,6] ])
// Array(3) [ NaN, NaN, NaN ]
```

While we can successfully iterate over the 3 items in the top-level `Array`, our
callback function can't perform operations like `[1,2] * 2`! We need to do
another `map` on the nested `Array`s:

```javascript
map(map(x => x * 2))([ [1,2], [3,4], [5,6] ])
// [ [2,4], [6,8], [10,12] ]
```

Well done! What else can you `map`? We're now going to leave charted waters and
venture into the unknown.

## `map` an `Object`

Let's say we have an `i18n` (short for "internationalization") object that we've
been given that has a terribly annoying issue: every translation is prefixed and
suffixed with an underscore (`_`)!

```javascript
const i18n = {
  'en-US': {
    dayMode: '_Day mode_',
    greeting: '_Hello!_',
    nightMode: '_Night Mode_'
  },
  'es-ES': {
    dayMode: '_Modo dÃ­a_',
    greeting: '_Â¡Hola!_'
    nightMode: '_Modo nocturno_'
  }
}
```

We could manually delete each one, or we could find and replace with our text
editor, or we could write a `for` loop to do this, but because we're super
awesome functional programmers, we'll try to `map` over the `Object` and write a
function that removes the prefixed & suffixed underscores (...then we copy and
paste that?  work with me here!).

Before we can do this, we need to see what happens when we call `.map()` on an
`Object`:

```javascript
i18n['en-US'].map(x => x.slice(1))
// TypeError: i18n['en-US'].map is not a function
```

Oh no! If we can't even fix the `en-US` `Object`, how are we supposed to fix
_all_ of them? Let's update our `map` function to handle `Object`s.

```javascript
// map :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
const map = fn => m => {
  if (isArray(m)) {
    return mapArray(fn, m)
  }

  if (isObject(m)) {
    return mapObject(fn, m)
  }
}

// isObject :: a -> Bool
const isObject = x =>
  !!x && Object.prototype.toString.call(x) === '[object Object]'

// mapObject :: ((a -> b), { k: a }) -> { k: b }
const mapObject = (fn, m) => {
  const obj = {}

  for (const [k, v] of Object.entries(m)) {
    obj[k] = fn(v)
  }

  return obj
}
```

Here, we test if something is an object by using [`Object.prototype.toString`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/toString)
and make sure to `.call(x)` instead of just `.toString(x)`, for this reason:

```javascript
Object.prototype.toString(null)
// "[object Object]"

Object.prototype.toString.call(null)
// "[object Null]"

Object.prototype.toString([])
// "[object Object]"

Object.prototype.toString.call([])
// "[object Array]"

Object.prototype.toString.call({})
// "[object Object]"
```

We then use our new `mapObject` function, whose signature is

```haskell
mapObject :: ((a -> b), { k: a }) -> { k: b }
```

`mapObject` takes a function from `a` to `b` and an `Object` with a key(s) and
some value(s), `a`, and returns an `Object` with a key(s) and some value(s) `b`.
In short, it maps the _values_ of an `Object`. Our `mapObject` function is
nothing more than a `for` loop over each value returned from
[`Object.entries()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/entries)!
It calls the callback function with each value and returns a new object with the
same key and a new, updated value.

Let's try it out:

```javascript
const i18n = {
  'en-US': {
    dayMode: '_Day mode_',
    greeting: '_Hello!_',
    nightMode: '_Night Mode_'
  },
  'es-ES': {
    dayMode: '_Modo dÃ­a_',
    greeting: '_Â¡Hola!_'
    nightMode: '_Modo nocturno_'
  }
}
map(x => x.slice(1, -1))(i18n['en-US'])
// {
//   dayMode: 'Day mode',
//   greeting: 'Hello!',
//   nightMode: 'Night Mode'
// }
```

Okay â€“ what about our entire `i18n` object?

```javascript
map(map(x => x.slice(1, -1)))(i18n)
// {
//  'en-US': {
//    dayMode: 'Day mode',
//    greeting: 'Hello!',
//    nightMode: 'Night Mode'
//  },
//  'es-ES': {
//    dayMode: 'Modo dÃ­a',
//    greeting: 'Â¡Hola!',
//    nightMode: 'Modo nocturno'
//  }
// }
```

Since we're dealing with nested objects, we need to use `map` on an `Object`
inside an `Object`. We pass a nested `map`ping function, and our little
underscore problem is gone!

## `map` a `Function`

Remember our functions `mult2` and `add10` from before?

```javascript
const add10 = x => x + 10
const mult2 = x => x * 2
```

What would happen if we used those as the arguments to our `map` function and
wanted them to be automatically composed together so that we can then provide a
value later?

```javascript
map(add10)(mult2)     // undefined
map(add10)(mult2)(12) // TypeError: map(...)(...) is not a function
```

Time for our `map` function to handle a `Function` as the second argument and
`compose` the two functions together:

```javascript
// map :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
const map = fn => m => {
  if (isArray(m)) {
    return mapArray(fn, m)
  }

  if (isObject(m)) {
    return mapObj(fn, m)
  }

  if (isFunction(m)) {
    return compose(fn, m)
  }
}

// isFunction :: a -> Bool
const isFunction = x => typeof x === 'function'

// compose :: ((b -> c), (a -> b)) -> a -> c
const compose = (f, g) => x => f(g(x))
```

And when we run our previously failed code again,

```javascript
map(add10)(mult2)     // function compose(x)
map(add10)(mult2)(12) // 44
```

we can see that calling `map` with two functions returns a composition of those
two functions, and calling that result with a primitive value (`12`) gives us
back our result, `44`.

## `map` a `Functor`

When we learned about `map`ping `Array`s before, we learned that `Array`s are
`Functor`s because they adhere to the laws of _identity_ and _composition_;
i.e., they are `map`pable.

There are all sorts of other data structures that implement a `map` method, just
like `Array.prototype` does, and we want to be able to handle those, too!

We currently have all the tools required to implement `map` for `Functor`s
without even knowing how they might work! All we need to know is, "Does it
implement `map` as a `Function`?" Let's see what we can come up with!

```javascript
// map :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
const map = fn => m => {
  if (isFunction(m)) {
    return compose(fn, m)
  }

  if (isArray(m)) {
    return mapArray(fn, m)
  }

  if (isFunctor(m)) {
    return mapFunctor(fn, m)
  }

  if (isObject(m)) {
    return mapObj(fn, m)
  }
}

// isFunction :: a -> Bool
const isFunction = x => typeof x === 'function'

// isFunctor :: a -> Bool
const isFunctor  = x => !!x && isFunction(x['map'])

// mapFunctor :: Functor f => ((a -> b), f a) -> f b
const mapFunctor = (fn, m) => m.map(fn)
```

That is surprisingly simple, isn't it? We use our `isFunction` check from before
to test if `m` has a `map` property that is a `Function`, then we call `map` on
`m` and pass it the callback `Function` in `mapFunctor`.

You might be thinking that `mapArray` and `mapFunctor` could use the same handler
because `Array`s are `Functors`, and you are correct; however, because of the
extra implementation bits that come back from `Array.prototype.map`, we'll keep
them separate and only call the callback to `Array.prototype.map` with the
currently iterated item. Here's the difference:

```javascript
// mapArray :: ((a -> b), Array a) -> Array b
const mapArray = (fn, m) => m.map(x => (fn(x))

// mapFunctor :: Functor f => ((a -> b), f a) -> f b
const mapFunctor = (fn, m) => m.map(fn)
```

If you don't care about this, it's totally acceptable to not include the `Array`
bits at all and use the `Functor` `map`[^8] to handle the `map`ping of `Array`s,
since they're `Functor`s.

[^8]: `Functor` `map` is also known as
[`fmap`](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/The_Functor_class). &ensp;

To test our `Functor` `map`ping, we'll use [crocks](https://crocks.dev) to
provide us access to an algebraic data type called
[`Maybe`](https://crocks.dev/docs/crocks/Maybe.html).

```javascript
import { compose, option, prop } from 'crocks'

const company = {
  name: 'Pearce Software, LLC',
  locations: [
    'Charleston, SC, USA',
    'Auckland, NZ',
    'London, England, UK'
  ]
}

prop('foo', company)       // Nothing
prop('locations', company) // Just [String]

option([], prop('foo', company))
// []

option([], prop('locations', company))
// [
//   'Charleston, SC, USA',
//   'Auckland, NZ',
//   'London, England, UK'
// ]

const getLocations = compose(option([]), prop('locations'))
getLocations(company)
// [
//   'Charleston, SC, USA',
//   'Auckland, NZ',
//   'London, England, UK'
// ]
```

Pump the breaks! What's all this `Just` and `Nothing` stuff? We're not going to
focus on `Maybe`s today[^9], but the short version is that the `locations` property
_may_ or _may not_ be present in the object, so we encapsulate that uncertainty
inside of a `Maybe` algebraic data type via the `prop` function, and we provide
a default value via the `option` function that the `Maybe` can fall back to in
the event of not being able to find `locations`.

[^9]: If you're an [egghead.io](https://egghead.io) subscriber, [Andy Van
Slaars](https://twitter.com/avanslaars/) has a great course, [Safer JavaScript
with the Maybe Type](https://egghead.io/courses/safer-javascript-with-the-maybe-type),
or you can check out [a Haskell article on The Functor
class](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/The_Functor_class). &ensp;

Why does this matter? We want to `map` a `Maybe`, and the `prop` function will
give us access to one. Let's see what it looks like:

```javascript
import { compose, option, prop } from 'crocks'

const upcase = x => x.toUpperCase()

const getLocations =
  compose(option([]), map(map(upcase)), prop('locations'))

getLocations({}) // []

getLocations(company)
// [
//   'CHARLESTON, SC, USA',
//   'AUCKLAND, NZ',
//   'LONDON, ENGLAND, UK'
// ]
```

Okay, cool! But why are we `map`ping twice?

When we work with algebraic data types like `Maybe`, instead of writing `if
(dataIsValid) doSomething`, the `map` method on a `Maybe` gives us access to
the value inside the `Maybe` (our `locations`), but it does so _only if the data
is available_.

Once we have access to the `locations`, we then use `map` again to uppercase
each location.

## `throw`ing Out Bad Data

What happens if the arguments passed to `map` aren't a `Function` and a
`Functor`?

```javascript
map(null)([1,2,3])    // TypeError: fn is not a function
map(x => x * 2)(null) // undefined
map(null)(null)       // undefined
```

I think we can provide some more helpful messaging to guide users of our `map`
tool on how to use it correctly.

```javascript
// map :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
const map = fn => m => {
  if (!isFunction(fn)) {
    throw new TypeError(`map: Please provide a Function for the first argument`)
  }

  // ...our other handlers...

  throw new TypeError(`map: Please provide a Functor or Object for the second argument`)
}

map(null)([1,2,3])    // TypeError: map: Please provide a Function for the first argument
map(x => x * 2)(null) // TypeError: map: Please provide a Functor or Object for the second argument
map(null)(null)       // TypeError: map: Please provide a Function for the first argument
```

Now, when we provide bad arguments, we're told exactly what we need to do.

## Wrapping Up

Congratulations and thank you for making it to the end! If you want to play
around with what we created, check out this CodeSandbox:
https://codesandbox.io/s/bitter-grass-tknwb.

Here is our code from today in its entirety:

```javascript
const { compose, option, prop } = require('crocks')

// map :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
const map = fn => m => {
  if (!isFunction(fn)) {
    throw new TypeError(`map: Please provide a Function for the first argument`)
  }

  if (isFunction(m)) {
    return compose(fn, m)
  }

  if (isArray(m)) {
    return mapArray(fn, m)
  }

  if (isFunctor(m)) {
    return mapFunctor(fn, m)
  }

  if (isObject(m)) {
    return mapObj(fn, m)
  }

  throw new TypeError(`map: Please provide a Functor or Object for the second argument`)
}

// we're opting for crocks' compose, instead
// compose :: ((b -> c), (a -> b)) -> a -> c
// const compose = (f, g) => x => f(g(x))

// isArray :: a -> Bool
const isArray = x => Array.isArray(x)

// isFunction :: a -> Bool
const isFunction = x => typeof x === 'function'

// isFunctor :: a -> Bool
const isFunctor  = x => !!x && isFunction(x['map'])

// isObject :: a -> Bool
const isObject = x =>
  !!x && Object.prototype.toString.call(x) === '[object Object]'

// mapArray :: ((a -> b), Array a) -> Array b
const mapArray = (fn, m) => {
  const newArray = []

  for (let i = 0; i < m.length; i++) {
    newArray.push(fn(m[i]))
  }

  return newArray
}
// realistically, you should use this mapArray:
// const mapArray = (fn, m) => m.map(x => fn(x))

// mapObj :: (a -> b) -> { k: a } -> { k: b }
const mapObj = (fn, m) => {
  const obj = {}

  for (const [k, v] of Object.entries(m)) {
    obj[k] = fn(v)
  }

  return obj
}

// mapFunctor :: Functor f => ((a -> b), f a) -> f b
const mapFunctor = (fn, m) => m.map(fn)
```
