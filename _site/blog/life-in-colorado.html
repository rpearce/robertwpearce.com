<p>One month ago, with an entire world to travel at my fingertips, I chose to temporarily move to Denver, Colorado. For years I have heard great things about the people, hiking, skiing and beer, so I decided to give them a try.</p>
<h2 id="the-people">The People</h2>
<p>The following statement may cause me a bit of flack in the South, but</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;Denver has the most welcoming population I&#39;ve ever come across
in my travels.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Never in my life have I met such a warm, trusting, &quot;do good&quot; people who have a blind affinity for strangers of all shapes, colors and creeds. Since my first day here, I have questioned whether I simply haven&#39;t met enough people or experienced enough of the city to see its faults. But my initial premise is supported day after day and experience after experience.</p>
<p>One can tell much about the culture of a city by a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>the attitude of its drivers towards foot traffic</li>
<li>the treatment of and by service industry workers</li>
<li>its beer</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="foot-traffic">Foot Traffic</h3>
<p>Drivers consistently stop for pedestrians to cross the street. Who would have thought this a novel concept? Additionally, if a driver pulls their car in to a cross-walk, 9 times out of 10 that person will wave, apologize and attempt to back their car up so folks on foot have space to walk. This alone speaks reams about a community.</p>
<h3 id="service-industry-workers">Service Industry Workers</h3>
<p>I am a harsh judge of patrons&#39; character when it comes to their interactions with service industry workers. Is it right to judge people? No. Does doing so help me guage not only the person I&#39;m speaking with, but a community as a whole? Yes, for watching an unnecessarily rude man be put in his place by other restaurant-goers is something special.</p>
<p>On the other side of the coin, I have yet to meet a rude person providing me food &amp; bev service. A great example is at <a href="http://renegadebrewing.com/">Renegade Brewing</a>. The bar tenders here struck up conversation while I was having a beer and burger, alone, on Valentine&#39;s Day. After a few minutes of conversation, I was introduced to some of their friends across the bar, and we had great conversation and beer before parting ways.</p>
<h3 id="the-beer">The Beer</h3>
<p>There are &gt;200 breweries in Denver. &#39;Nuff said. These people like to have a good time.</p>
<h2 id="remote-working">Remote Working</h2>
<p>My employer, <a href="https://www.articulate.com/">Articulate</a>, has paid for me to work three days per week out of the <a href="http://densitycoworking.com/">Density CoWorking</a> spot. Density is located in a fun neighborhood about one block from the <a href="http://marczykfinefoods.com/">Marczyk Food Market</a>. You know a place is cool when they have wall-mounted unicorn decor:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/rpearce.github.io/colorado/unicorn.jpg" alt="Unicorn" title="Unicorn" /></p>
<p>There are heaps of unique and delicious coffee shops to work from, as well. My favorite, thus far, is the <a href="http://denverbicyclecafe.com/">Denver Bike Cafe</a> on 17th Street.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/rpearce.github.io/colorado/denverbicyclecafe.jpg" alt="Denver Bicycle Shop" title="Denver Bicycle Shop" /></p>
<h2 id="skiing">Skiing</h2>
<p>While skiing in Denver could be fun after a heavy snow, the mountains are nearby and ripe for adventure. I&#39;ll let the pictures speak for themselves.</p>

<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap up</h2>
<p>I have only begun to scratch the surface with all that Denver has to offer and look forward to another month here.</p>
