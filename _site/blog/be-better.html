<p>We are not always the people we strive to be. Many of us want to be better versions of ourselves: wiser, kinder, stronger, skinnier. However, we often find it is ourselves that get in the way of this.</p>
<p>Some time ago, I began removing things from my life that did not help me on the path to being the person I desired to be. This is a very painful yet effective attempt at a remedy. Unfortunately, it is only a piece of the puzzle. While external factors influence our habits and tendencies a great deal, all decisions have an ultimate decision-maker: you.</p>
<p>I could go on with this post for days. Instead, I&#39;ll make it simple:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Be kinder to the cashier at the grocery store.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Be someone whose positive attitude inspires others.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Be confident in accomplishing your goals or lifestyle changes.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Be better than you were yesterday.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
