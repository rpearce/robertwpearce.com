          <p>Two weeks ago today, I quit a rewarding and lucrative job without having another gig lined up. Oh, sh*t.</p>
<h2 id="the-immediate-aftermath">The Immediate Aftermath</h2>
<p>The following day consisted of my mind completely shutting down after being unable to answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do I do about health &amp; dental insurance?</li>
<li>How am I going to pay for life?<ul>
<li>rent (in London)</li>
<li>food/house supplies</li>
<li>transportation</li>
<li>what if I break my leg?</li>
<li>what if I get <a href="http://www.medicaldaily.com/55000-snake-bite-has-uninsured-maryland-woman-jules-weiss-searching-options-anti-venom-costs-more">bit by a snake like Jules Weiss</a> and get footed a $55,000 bill?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Should I start looking for a new job?</li>
<li>Should I get an actual undergrad degree in the industry I&#39;m in? (how to afford this without debt?)</li>
<li>Should I go to business school? (how to afford this without debt?)</li>
<li>Am I in the right industry?</li>
<li>Should I start over?</li>
</ul>
<p>Apple&#39;s Healthkit app on my phone told me I walked <em>10 steps</em> that day and not many more the next. Clearly, something had to be done.</p>
<h2 id="organizing-my-concerns">Organizing My Concerns</h2>
<p>After a few days of lethargy and absorption of what I&#39;d done and what had happened, my mind became restless and went back in to &quot;solve all the things!&quot; mode. When something feels like too big of a task, I remember what my father has asked me since childhood, <em>How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time.</em> Now, I am not advocating for the consumption of elephants, but you get the point. It was time to break the problem of &quot;What do I do next?&quot; in to many smaller, solvable problems.</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: I am not an healthcare nor life expert; this is a story.</em></p>
<h3 id="healthcare-retirement-account-s-">Healthcare &amp; Retirement Account(s)</h3>
<p>When it comes to the unknown, humility is an asset, for you cannot possibly know everything about everything, so it&#39;s okay to ask people for help. If you&#39;re in this position, make sure you listen to your human resources contact at the company you&#39;re leaving, specifically</p>
<ul>
<li>how long your healthcare is covered for under their plan</li>
<li>the details about making the COBRA election to extend your healthcare at your own cost</li>
<li>if you have a high-deductible healthcare plan and have a health savings account (HSA) of your own, what can you do with this? How does that work, and where do I go from here with it? It is yours, but their advice is valuable.</li>
<li>how you can rollover your retirement accounts in to other ones? (I have my own, managed via Schwab)</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, consult your bank/brokerage firm/family/life liason about what your options are and what they think you need to do to ensure you are handling these things correctly. This is what I have been doing, and it is such a relief when someone can help you down your path.</p>
<h3 id="paying-for-life">Paying for Life</h3>
<p>Naturally, since I have no income until I either sell a product or do freelance work, expenses have had to be slashed. Eating out, pubs, entertainment, etc., are not great expenses until I add up their cost over a year. Rent, healthcare and car insurance are the major killers. There&#39;s no way I&#39;d be able to even be thinking this way with a family to support, so I&#39;ve got it relatively easy. Luckily, I saved up a bit of money before quitting, so I am cushioned for a little bit.</p>
<p>However, frugal is the word.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-i-want-need-">What Do I Want/Need?</h3>
<p>Once I got past the immediate financial and health issues I was able to start tackling the next question: <em>where do I want and need?</em></p>
<p>I came up with potential paths to go down, sought advice from family and friends, and came up with the things I need in my life:</p>
<ul>
<li>be where I need to be (with my significant other after a year apart)</li>
<li>recover from the mindset I&#39;ve been in for the last 6 months and allow myself to change and not be defined by it</li>
<li>level-up my programming skills and algorithmic knowledge</li>
<li>make something that matters and which matters <em>to me</em></li>
<li>work for myself for a bit</li>
</ul>
<p>There were so many other contenders that, after examing what mattered to me and defining what was just outside my sphere of knowledge and influence, didn&#39;t make sense for right now.</p>
<h2 id="turning-a-new-leaf">Turning a New Leaf</h2>
<p>Currently, I am spending my days focused on learning and working. Here&#39;s my routine:</p>
<ul>
<li>wake up, brew some tea or coffee</li>
<li>light exercise</li>
<li>solve coding problems on <a href="http://www.codewars.com/">CodeWars</a></li>
<li>work on basic algebra/trig/geometry/calculus skills that I either don&#39;t remember or never learned via worksheets</li>
<li>spend 4-5 hours on a MOOC (massive open online course)</li>
<li>exercise</li>
<li>spend the rest of the working day working on my own projects (or, eventually, freelance work)</li>
<li>play my guitar and record music or a potential podcast</li>
<li>enjoy life and friends</li>
</ul>
<p>This daily routine allows me to get things done that matter to me, cut out the things that don&#39;t and make sure I stop and smell the flowers along the way.</p>
