<p>I spend the majority of my time writing software for <a href="http://www.articulate.com" title="Articulate">Articulate</a>. This isn&#39;t the offical mantra, but it is how I think of the company:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;Work when you want,<br />
where you want;<br />
just don&#39;t be a jerk.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sound too good to be true? It is true.</p>
<p>Articulate is a &quot;remote&quot; or &quot;virtual&quot; company, meaning it has no physical offices anywhere in the world, and everyone works wherever they like. Many of my colleagues work from home, whereas others tend to shift around a bit. It is this freedom that was (and <em>is</em>) a primary driving force for me wanting to work with this company.</p>
<h2 id="locations-thus-far">Locations Thus Far</h2>
<p>London is an expensive town, especially when you&#39;re exchanging American Dollars for British Pounds Sterling. <a href="http://nomadlist.io/" title="NomadList.IO">NomadList.IO</a>, a site that ranks cities to work remotely from, does not treat London kindly. At the time of writing, London has a -89 reputation&hellip; on a scale where positive is a good thing. While it is an expensive town, it is also incredibly friendly, and there is no shortage of WiFi.</p>
<p>So, where have I worked over the past two days? For starters, I had a small taste of <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/South+Kensington/@51.49409,-0.17411,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x487605429cf5afd1:0xfef74f40edb435de?hl=en" title="South Kensington Google Map">South Kensington</a>. I worked in a small coffee shop 2 blocks from the <a href="http://www.vam.ac.uk" title="Victoria and Albert Museum">Victoria and Albert Museum</a>, and around lunch I took a stroll through a few of the free galleries before receiving word that my roommate&#39;s girlfriend was locked <em>in</em> the apartment and could not get out. She was freed soon thereafter when I returned home and unlocked the door.</p>
<p>Today was spent mostly near Clapham Junction (5-10 minute walk from our house) in, first, a Starbucks and then in an Italian cafe up the hill from our house (1-2 minute walk). Starbucks is fantastic for attempting to offer free WiFi to their customers. I&#39;m not sure who started that trend, but it is great. However, in any big city I go to, Starbucks&#39; WiFi never actually works. It reminds me of the $1/ticket Megabus WiFi in the States (in short, it doesn&#39;t work). Thankful as I am for even having access to the Internet, whereas so many people are without, I require it for my job. And I need it to be fast. Luckily, the little Italian cafe (ran by Francesca and, I believe, her son) have blazing fast internet.</p>
<h2 id="the-experience">The Experience</h2>
<p>I love <em>not</em> working in an office. I love the freedom. I love being able to walk and ride around and do what I want (or need) to do while still being a contributing member of my team.</p>
<p>Many people I know ask me,</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;When are you going to get a real job?&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>I always respond with, &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know&hellip;&quot; But what I want to say is,</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I have a real job. I have a salary, I have benefits and I have responsibility. <strong>Just because your definition of a real job involves long hours, living for weekends and generally hating life does not mean that it is a universal truth by which all must abide.</strong>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Instead of spending loads of time during the workday perusing
<a href="http://www.cnn.com" title="CNN">CNN</a>
or <a href="http://www.reddit.com" title="Reddit">Reddit</a>
or <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com" title="Hacker News">Hacker News</a>,
I am out exploring, meeting new people and taking in as much as my limited time here will
allow me.</p>
<p>London, so far, has been amazing and has allowed me to leave my comfort zone and discover
people, places and experiences that I would never have had if I would have just stayed home.</p>
