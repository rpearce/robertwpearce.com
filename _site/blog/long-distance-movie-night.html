<p>In a long-distance relationship? I currently am, and it sucks, but that will change someday. My SO (significant other), who is an ocean away and five hours ahead, and I were recently celebrating the passing of time and wanted to share a movie night. How were we to do this?</p>
<p>There are many options out there that we explored, such as <a href="https://letsgaze.com">Gaze</a>, which has a great design (though a questionably shaky platform), but only supports <code>.mp4</code>, <code>.ogg</code> and <code>.woff</code> files (even if you alter the webpage to accept all file types). We had our movie in <code>.avi</code> and <code>.mov</code>, so this wasn&#39;t going to work.</p>
<p>We also tried a few other services but to no avail, so we put our thinking caps on and solved the problem with these simple steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you and your SO each have a copy of the movie (sharing it via <a href="https://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> is a <em>big</em> help here)</li>
<li>Use Skype to video call your SO</li>
<li>Open wine</li>
<li>Do a countdown (3...2...1) for when each of you should click play</li>
<li>Turn on the mute button when you&#39;re not talking/commenting so that his/her movie&#39;s sound doesn&#39;t come over the speakers</li>
</ol>
<p>This was surprisingly easy, and Skype lets you keep a small version of the person you&#39;re video calling on top of all other screens, so I put her on the top left of my screen and presto! Long-distance movie night.`</p>
