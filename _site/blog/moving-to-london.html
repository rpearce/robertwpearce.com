<p>2 months ago I decided I wanted to go to London for an indefinite amount of time.</p>
<p>There were no external driving factors behind this decision; no significant other, no new job, no criminal charges, no desire to leave my home in Charleston, SC.</p>
<p>I love my family, friends, beaches, the spartina grass (marshes), the plough mud, and the
odd&mdash;yet wonderful&mdash;assortment of personalities that exist in Charleston.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;If everything is so wonderful, why leave?&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Because I can. Because of this list of things I don&#39;t have:</p>
<ul>
<li>no wife</li>
<li>no kids</li>
<li>no house</li>
<li>no debt</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is another way to view this list:</p>
<ul>
<li>wife-free</li>
<li>kid-free</li>
<li>house-free</li>
<li>debt-free</li>
</ul>
<p>I understand that &frac34; of the items on that list are desired by many folks, and that what I have just described could also be classified as &quot;responsibility-free.&quot; Or, as I have understood before, that <em>the life of the traveler is rootless and thereby does not bear the burden of creating something lasting</em>. I find this statement accurate; however, I also find that safety makes me complacent and breeds stagnation and settling: the opposite of my battle and striving for excellence, or the Greek <em>aret√©</em>. Thus, in order to better myself, I decided to shake things up a bit!</p>
<p>Additionally, and worthy of note, every single person I spoke with about traveling this way said this:</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;If I were you, I&#39;d be gone in a second.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>I will miss my grandparents, parents, siblings, my dogs, aunts, uncles, cousins, surfing, and everything that makes Charleston great.</p>
<p>But I shall return!</p>
<h2 id="my-time-thus-far">My Time Thus far</h2>
<p>After serenading the Delta counter attendants in the Charleston airport with my guitar and song, I had a sleepless and safe flight to London!</p>
<p>When I finished riding a number of trains and other ground transportation, I arrived in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/preview?q=clapham+london&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ei=ApsEVOSbJaeu0QXc84HYCw&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ" title="Clapham Google Map">Clapham</a> at Sam&#39;s house, where I was greeted with smiles, cheers, and Heineken.</p>
<p>Soon thereafter, I decided to get to know my new area better. My solution? <em>Go on a run and get lost.</em> Here is my fitbit from that day:</p>
<p><img data-lazy-image="https://s3.amazonaws.com/rpearce.github.io/moving-to-london/fitbit.jpg" alt="fitbit data" title="fitbit data" width="300" /></p>
<p>You could say I got lost. I like to think I was &quot;exploring.&quot; Nevertheless, I had a fantastic time and look forward to many more.</p>
